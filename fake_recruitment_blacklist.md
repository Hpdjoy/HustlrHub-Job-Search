# List of Suspected Fake or Spam Recruitment Companies & Internship Scams (India, 2024-2025)

Based on recent discussions on Reddit (r/developersIndia) and other tech forums, the following companies and entities have been flagged by the community as suspicious, fake, or engaging in unethical recruitment practices (such as asking for money).

## 🚨 "Pay-to-Work" or "Exam Fee" Scams
These companies often ask for a registration fee, examination fee, or training fee before hiring. **Legitimate companies NEVER ask for money from candidates.**

*   **Trinet Technologies (trinet.in)**
    *   **Scam Type:** Fake "Capstone Exam" fee.
    *   **Details:** Candidates receive an email/message about being shortlisted for an "Associate Software Engineer" role. They are asked to pay ~₹1250 for a "Capstone Exam" which is refundable only if cleared.
    *   **Status:** Confirmed scam by multiple users.
*   **Techwave Solutions**
    *   **Scam Type:** Recruitment test fee.
    *   **Details:** Asks for ~₹950 for a "TCR" recruitment test after a telephonic round.
    *   **Status:** Flagged as a scam.

## ⚠️ Internship "Mills" & Unpaid Internship Scams
These entities often offer "internships" that are essentially unpaid labor or sales funnels. They may provide "offer letters" very easily but offer no real mentorship or pay. Some may ask for money for "training" or "certificates".

*   **Unified Mentor**
    *   **Type:** Unpaid/Paid training disguised as internship.
    *   **Details:** Described as a "sales funnel disguised as hiring".
*   **Younity**
    *   **Type:** Similar to Unified Mentor.
*   **Codsoft**
    *   **Type:** Internship mill. Often unpaid, task-based with no real value.
*   **Cognifyz Technologies**
    *   **Type:** Internship scam/mill.
*   **Tripple One Solutions**
    *   **Type:** Internship scam.
*   **IMUN (International Model United Nations)**

## 🚩 General Red Flags to Watch Out For
*   **Asking for Money:** Any request for security deposit, registration fee, exam fee, or training fee is a major red flag.
*   **Too Good to Be True:** "Direct joining", "No interview", or "Instant offer letter".
*   **Generic Emails:** Emails from generic domains (gmail, yahoo) or suspicious domains (trinet.in instead of trinet.com - note: TriNet is a real US company, scammers impersonate them).
*   **Document Scams:** Asking for original documents or sensitive info (PAN, UAN) *before* a proper offer and joining process.
